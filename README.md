## Ripple Server Switcher
This is the rss source code. There's no git history because I've used git with it, both on Github and on this private Gogs, simply because we don't update it that often. If you don't trust me, you're allowed to decompile the downloadable server switcher and compare the code.  
**Note that the hash of the downloaded version and of the compiled one won't match, because the compiler adds some data to the executable that is different each time you compile the project.**  
I know that the code completely sucks, this was my first (and last) C# project I've ever made.
